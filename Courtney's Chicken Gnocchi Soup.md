# Chicken Gnocchi Soup Recipe

## Ingredients
- 1-2 large chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1-2 large carrots, finely chopped
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 1-3 celery stalks (or a tiny amount of celery seed)
- A generous amount of minced garlic
- Olive oil or butter for sautéing
- 1 container of heavy cream (size based on preference)
- 2 boxes of chicken broth
- Seasonings: onion powder, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, rosemary/thyme/Italian seasoning, bouillon cube
- 1-2 packages of dry gnocchi
- Parmesan cheese, grated
- Spinach (fresh or frozen)

## Instructions
1. **Prepare Mirepoix:** In a large stock pot, heat olive oil or butter. Add chopped carrots, onion, celery, and a large amount of minced garlic. Cook until onions are brown, carrots are soft, and celery is translucent. A little salt can help to sweat the vegetables faster.

2. **Cook Chicken:** Once the vegetables are nearly done, add the chicken cubes. Cook until the chicken is mostly done.

3. **Deglaze and Simmer:** Add half a box of chicken broth to deglaze the pot, scraping the flavors off the bottom. Then add the remaining 1.5 boxes of broth. Bring the mixture to a boil.

4. **Season:** Start with a chicken bouillon cube and add garlic powder, onion powder, and smaller amounts of other seasonings. Adjust the seasonings to taste, keeping in mind that the flavors will dilute slightly when you add the cream.

5. **Add Gnocchi:** Once boiling, add the gnocchi, ensuring it doesn’t clump together. Reduce heat to medium. Once gnocchi floats, proceed to the next step.

6. **Add Cream and Cheese:** Add the container of heavy cream. Do not boil after adding cream to avoid curdling. Add 1/8-1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, adjusting to taste.

7. **Finish with Spinach:** After the Parmesan is mixed in, add spinach. Let it wilt if fresh, or cook through if frozen.

## Notes
- Adjust seasonings to your preference.
- The soup makes several servings, perfect for freezing leftovers.
- Serve with additional Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes on top, if desired.
